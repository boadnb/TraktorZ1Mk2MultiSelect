Discovered where Filter button action occurs in \CSI\Z1MK2\Z1MK2.qml
The code snippet is below
Need to investigate this code and its references to find how to make filter buttons follow decks on all pages.
  Z1MK2FXSelector
  {
    name: "channel_fx_selector"
    surface: "surface"
    leftDeckIdx: mapping.leftDeckIdx
    rightDeckIdx: mapping.rightDeckIdx

    shift: mapping.shift
    filterPushAction: filterPushActionProp.value
    channelFxPushAction: channelFxPushActionProp.value
    channelFxShiftPushAction: channelFxShiftPushActionProp.value
  }

Buttons are specifically assigned to the lines
    leftDeckIdx: mapping.leftDeckIdx
    rightDeckIdx: mapping.rightDeckIdx
